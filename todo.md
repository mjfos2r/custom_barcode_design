# List of improvements to make should I want to take this tool further
As I pursue more complicated multiplexed experiments, I am going to need to have a robust method of barcode design.
This tool may serve that purpose. Though it will need refactoring and several things added to ease use and implementation.

Primarily the addition of comprehensive logging, a better explanation of what subcomponents are being executed, and more params.

Logging is the primary need.

The next point is derivative to that.

The additional params is more of a personal complaint but it would be nice to get a set number of output barcodes.

Above all, this is a cool tool, but for my use will need expansion. This may or may not get further time.

Until then, here it shall sit.

Many thanks to the original authors for releasing their source and responding to my request.

Addditional Comment: Compilation arch also absolutely needs to be specified in the NVCC command as it barely used any of the A800 we have. Perhaps that's due to the nerfed double precision floating point throughput. (Hardcapped at 1teraflop because CHYNA. of course it is)

Anyway, if this was my personal GPU I'd find a way to jailbreak the firmware to run A100 firmware natively but I'm not entirely sure it's possible as the nerf might be hardware. Though that implies these A800 are all low bins. Oh well, it's still more than I know what to do with (for now). Anyway, that's all I've got to say on this for now.
